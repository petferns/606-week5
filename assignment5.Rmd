# Exercise

The chart below describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations. Your task is to:
(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above.
You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so
that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy
and transform your data.
(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.
(4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative
descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your
homework submission:
 The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
 The URL for your rpubs.com web page.

# Solution :

### Read the csv file from GitHub with the table data and replace empty values with NA

```{r}
csv <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petferns/607-week5/master/untidy.csv", na.strings = c("", "NA"))
head(csv)
```

#### We see a empty row at row number 3, all variables value are NA so we don't need this row, lets neglect it.

```{r}
csv <- csv[!apply(is.na(csv[1:7]),1,all), ]

```

### Let us rename the 1st and 2nd column 

```{r}
# Renaming the first column to Airline and second to Status
names(csv)[1] <- "Airline"
names(csv)[2] <- "Status"
head(csv)
```
#### We need to replace the NA in row 2 with **ALASKA** and replace NA in row 4 with **AM WEST** assuming the row is for previous Airline

```{r}
for(i in 2:nrow(csv)) {
  
  if(is.na(csv$Airline[i])){
    csv$Airline[i] <- csv$Airline[i-1]
  }
}
```

#### Let us now apply gather function to make the wide structure to long with key value pair as City and Count.

```{r}
wide_to_long <- gather(csv, "City", "Count", 3:7)
head(wide_to_long)
```

#### Let us now apply spread function on Status column so that each distinct value becomes a column

```{r}
transformed <- spread(wide_to_long,Status,Count)
datatable(transformed, extensions = 'Scroller', options = list(scrollY = 200, scroller = TRUE ))
```

#### Calculate the overall ontime performance and compare over plot

```{r}
overall_ontime <- transformed %>% group_by(Airline) %>% summarize(avg_ontime = mean(`on time`))
head(overall_ontime)
ggplot(overall_ontime ,aes(x= Airline, y=avg_ontime, fill=Airline)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())


```

#### Calculate the per city ontime performance and comapre over plot

```{r}
percity_ontime <- transformed %>% group_by(Airline,City) %>% summarize(avg_ontime = mean(`on time`))

ggplot(percity_ontime ,aes(x= City, y=avg_ontime, fill=Airline)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())
```

#### Calculate overall delay and compare over plot

```{r}
overall_delay <- transformed %>% group_by(Airline) %>% summarize(avg_delay = mean(`delayed`))
head(overall_delay)
ggplot(overall_delay ,aes(x= Airline, y=avg_delay, fill=Airline)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())
```

#### Calculate per-city delay and compare over plot
```{r}

percity_delay <- transformed %>% group_by(Airline,City) %>% summarize(avg_delay = mean(`delayed`))
head(percity_delay)
ggplot(percity_delay ,aes(x= City, y=avg_delay, fill=Airline)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())

```

####  Conclusion

As per the overall performance graph, we see **AM WEST** has higher ontime flights compared to **ALSAKA** but when we see the same over per city performance, except two cities remaining cities have almost similar performance for both airlines. In city Seattle **ALSAKA** has higher ontime flights then **AM WEST**

When we compare the delay overview, **AM WEST** has higher delayed flights and comparing the ontime graph **AM WEST** has higher ontime flights - which contradicts to itself. This also means that higher ontime flights doesn't guarantee lesser delay.
